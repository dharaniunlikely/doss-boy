  <p>MY LIFE</p>
  <p>1. Health
importance of health in life Being healthy is the single, most important part of our existence ‚Äî without good health, our lives can be cut short. That said, it‚Äôs important not to take good health for granted, and to instead feed our bodies the nutrients they deserve by eating a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, you can ‚Äúreduce your risk of chronic diseases (like heart disease and cancer), and promote your overall health‚Äù.
2. Family
While you may sometimes argue and get annoyed with your family, they are your unit and the ones that you can turn to in times of happiness and sorrow. No matter what you go through with your family, they will always be there to guide and support you and to help you learn and grow as a person. The love from a family member is unconditional and should not be taken for granted. Some people go through life without truly appreciating just how important having their family‚Äôs support is and spend the majority their existence feeling unhappy. So, if you don‚Äôt usually show your family how much they mean to you, now is the time to start!
3. Friends
Just like family, friends are a vital part of our existence and happiness. They are people that can share the best parts of your life with you and will be there as a confidant when you need to talk about personal issues. While real friends are hard to come by, most will have a handful of trusted friends that they can rely on. And even though you may outgrow certain friends during different stages of your life, you will have opportunities to form new relationships with people that you come across.
4. Love
Love is the epicenter of every aspect of your life ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt just relate to having a romantic partner. You will love your partner in a unique way, but you will also have unchangeable affection for your family and friends. Love is also the feeling that will drive you throughout your career, extracurricular activities, interests and hobbies. Moreover, you will experience love in its varying forms; you may go on holiday and fall in love with a particular city, cuisine or culture. What‚Äôs vital is that you embrace everything that you love and enjoy.

5. Purpose
Looking for purpose in life Having a purpose is a fundamental component of living a fulfilling life. Without purpose, we won‚Äôt have the motivation to achieve great things or even do something simple such as getting out of bed in the morning. According to psychologist Steve Taylor, not having a purpose ‚Äúmakes us more vulnerable to boredom, anxiety and depression‚Äù. Meanwhile, having a strong sense of purpose can have a positive effect on our lives. If you take a page out of the books of successful entrepreneurs, most of them made it by having a drive and a sense of purpose. They worked hard because they were confident of what they could achieve ‚Äî and this purpose is something that we need to follow to feel accomplished in life.
6. Passion
Along with purpose comes passion; our desires, our dreams and our hopes in life. When you‚Äôre passionate about something, you‚Äôre going to work hard to achieve it. For example, Huda Kattan was a self-established makeup artist, but her passion for cosmetics pushed her to build a beauty empire that‚Äôs now worth over $600 million. That said, passion looks different for everyone; some people will be passionate about giving back to society, while others will have a passion for personal gain. Just ensure that your passion is for a good cause and that it brings joy not only to yourself but to others, too.
7. Wellness
Besides having a healthy body, it‚Äôs essential to have a healthy mind also! Luckily, we live in a time where mental wellbeing is at the forefront, and those who struggle with any mental health disorders are being given the treatment and care that they need to lead a happy life. That said, there are many ways that you can improve your wellbeing. Find activities that help you relax, whether it‚Äôs meditating daily, listening to a motivational podcast or simply going for a walk to gather your thoughts. Whatever method you choose, ensure that your wellbeing is at the forefront of each of these activities.
8. Education
Having a good education will help you progress in life. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that you must complete higher education to be successful. What it does mean is that you should continue to learn new things on a daily basis. The method of education is entirely up to you ‚Äî you might want to watch an educational video, documentary or film, read a book, or watch the news. What is important is the knowledge you gain from your education and how you choose to apply it within your life.

9. Time
Having the ability to value time really matters in life. Time is precious and priceless, and it should be taken advantage of. When we have a better understanding of time, we can form good habits and structure our daily activities. We can do things that will help us progress and also schedule time to spend with family, friends and hobbies.
10. Water
vital and clean water Water is the most critical part of survival ‚Äî without clean water, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to live. Our bodies are made up of up to 60% of water, and it‚Äôs used in all our cells, organs and tissues to help regulate our temperature and maintain other bodily functions. Therefore, to ensure that we aren‚Äôt dehydrated and at risk of falling ill, we need to drink at least six glasses of water per day.</p>
